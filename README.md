# Amazon-MySQL
This application simulates Amazon's online marketplace by using a MySQL database along with Node js.<br><br>

## Application Development
* Created two seperate apps that will update the MySQL database in multiple ways.<br>
* Code validation that restricts a Customer from purchasing an item if there is not enough inventory. <br>
* Efficent Code writing with functions that perform callbacks and smooth program flow.<br>
* Used various NPM packages such as **inquirer** and **mysql**. <br>

## Inside the downloadable folder you will find two applications:
* One for Customers <br>
      This link provides a Demo of a Customer buying a product, therefore decreasing inventory in the MySQL database.
