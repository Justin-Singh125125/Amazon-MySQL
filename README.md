# Amazon-MySQL
This application simulates Amazon's online marketplace by using a MySQL database along with Node js.<br><br>

## Application Development
* Created two seperate apps that will update the MySQL database in multiple ways.<br>
* Code validation that restricts a Customer from purchasing an item if there is not enough inventory. <br>
* Efficent Code writing with functions that perform callbacks and smooth program flow.<br>
* Used various NPM packages such as **inquirer** and **mysql**. <br>

## Inside the downloadable folder you will find two applications:
* One for Customers <br>
      This link provides a demo of a **customer** buying a product, therefore decreasing inventory in the MySQL database.<br>

* One for Managers <br>
      This link provides a Demo of adding inventory to products through the **manager** application by accessing the MySQL database.<br>

## Side Notes
1. MySQL is run on a local server which means if you choose to download this package, the application will not run on startup, however, I did include the schemea and a csv file to create and populate your local database.<br>

2. Inside each of the applications you may need to change your connection settings in order to connect to the MySQL database.<br>

3. Lastly Run **NPM INSTALL** to install the npm packages that you need to further run the applications. <br>

4. **ENJOY**
